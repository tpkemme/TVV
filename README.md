# TVV: Tyler's Varying Vagrant Vagrants Variant

This is a variant of [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) with a couple of customizations specifically for a local development environment.  TVV is installed in the same way you would install [VVV](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv) and this setup assumes you are using the [VVV Site Wizard](https://github.com/bradp/vv) to create additional Wordpress installations.  The [VVV Dashboard](https://github.com/topdown/VVV-Dashboard) is already installed and includes a link in the top menu to the [Database Search and Replace Script](https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/).  This script is configured to work with any database that was created using the VVV Site Wizard, you simply need to specify which database you would like to run the script on.
